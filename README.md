**Abstract:**  
Erasable data mining has become increasingly important in recent years because it can provide helpful suggestions for material procurement in factory manufacturing. In traditional erasable data mining, only a single threshold is set to judge whether an itemset is erasable. In this paper, we extend the problem to multiple thresholds and propose an algorithm to solve it by considering the tightest constraint. We prove the problem under the tightest constraint has the downward-closure property, and thus, we can search the solution space efficiently. Experimental results also show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.
